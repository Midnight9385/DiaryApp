# DiaryApp
A diary app that I made, it uses serialization, a CRUD system, and a user system to allow you to write down journal entries related to an account and then close the application and reopen it and it all be saved

if you don't care about the code and just want to use it, the installer is in the "installer stuff and jar" folder.
The code is messy but this was the first time I was using half of these concepts so it was fun to do.
