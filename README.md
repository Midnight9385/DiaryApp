# DiaryApp
A diary app that I made, it uses serialization, a CRUD system, and a user system to allow you to write down journal entries related to an account and then close the application and reopen it and it all be saved. I also included an email login recovery system which uses an API to send your login information to the email you attached to the account. 

if you don't care about the code and just want to use it, the installer is in the "installer stuff and jar" folder.
The code is messy but this was the first time I was using half of these concepts so it was fun to do.

WIP - maybe adding emailing your entries to the email attached to your account

Note if you download the code there is a missing class that returns the string of the API access key due to the sensitive nature of API keys I couldn't include it in a public repository
